# FileSystem-HashMap

This is an implementation of a FileSystem using the HashMap data structure built from scratch. All the methods of this data structure are implemented with an average-case runtime of O(1) that optimizes the performance time. This FileSystem provides a simplified version of an efficient file system management system with useful filtering methods that can effectively filter all entries based on name, directory, and date modified. This system is also aimed at providing the optimal runtime performance.
